    "But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will
    give you a complete account of the system</strong>
     <i>and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the

    because
    <small> those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful.
    Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or </small> to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because
    occasionally <mark>circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial
    example, which of us</mark> <sub> ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who
    has any right to find fault with </sub> man<ins> who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, </ins> one who
   
    <sup>avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</sup>
